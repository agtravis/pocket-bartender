# Pocket Bartender

> We've created an App that does 3 main things. First it keeps track of what is in your real life liquor cabinet, you can add new items, and when you run out, you can remove them. Next, it can be used to get cool drink recipes to make with your liquor cabinet, or get inspired what to add to your cabinet next based on the suggestions. Finally, for those conscious of what they are consuming, we have a calorie counter to help users make decisions about which recipes to follow.

## General info

The purpose of the app is to help users get more creative when either hosting a group of people at a cocktail party, or even just when they are relaxing on their own. It is both an inventory tool and a reference guide, but based around a fun and social activity. The motivation behind the app was simple - just 3 web developers with a passion for trying new things, and if the new things happen to be adult beverages then that's just how the ingredients muddled!
